# Computational Security  
  
Computational security is a cryptographic paradigm that relies on the computational hardness of specific mathematical problems. Key aspects of computational security include:  
  
## Basis of Security  
- **Assumption:** Based on the assumption that certain mathematical problems are computationally hard to solve.  
- **Computational Difficulty:** Security is tied to the difficulty of breaking specific mathematical problems.  
  
## Security Assurance  
- **Conditional Security:** Offers conditional security, contingent on the assumed computational hardness.  
- **Practical Considerations:** Security analysis depends on the difficulty of solving problems within a reasonable time frame.  
  
## Adversary Model  
- **Bounded Resources:** Considers adversaries with bounded computational resources.  
- **Polynomial-Time:** Security is analyzed based on the assumption that certain problems cannot be efficiently solved by polynomial-time algorithms.  
  
## Practical Implementations  
- **Widespread Use:** More commonly used in practical applications due to its practicality.  
- **Design Flexibility:** Allows for the design of cryptographic protocols based on the presumed hardness of specific mathematical problems.  
  
Computational security is prevalent in real-world cryptographic applications, offering practical solutions based on the presumed difficulty of computational problems.

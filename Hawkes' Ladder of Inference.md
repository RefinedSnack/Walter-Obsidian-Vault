### Hawkes' Ladder of Inference  
1) The general objection is that archaeology itself is limited to mere chronicle   
2) The objection is when it comes to explanation, the first problem is when, where, what, but it does not answer how or why.  
  
  
# Hawkes' Ladder of Inference  
Two things are needed  
  
1) [Technology](./Technology.md)  
  
2) Economics  
- environment  
- remnants  
- imports/exports  
- housing situation  
  
3) Social/Political questions are much more difficult  
- even less to go off of.   
  
4) Ritual & Religion  
make comparisons between modern and ancient lifestyles  
  
example:  
we throw coins in a wishing well, so these axes we keep finding in the river could be a similar kind of practice

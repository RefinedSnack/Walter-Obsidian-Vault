# History of AI  
  
### 1943-1956  
- Turing test  
- AI becomes canonized as a field (Dartmouth college)  
  
### 1952 - 1969  
- Early enthusiasm  
- Big expectations  
- Solved problems like:  
	- Checkers  
	- Proving a theorem  
	- Block world  
	- Algorithms for logical reasoning  
### 1966 - 1974  
- Computational complexity and intractability became problems  
- Needed better hardware  
- 1969 - limitations of neural networks identified  
### 1969 - 1979  
- Knowledge based systems emerged  
- Not active learning on this front  
- Success of rule-based systems  
	- Brittle and overly specific  
  
### 1980 - 1988  
- Expect systems industry emerged  
- Japan tried to build a super computer  
  
### 1986 - 2023  
- Scientific method  
- Machine Learning is invented  
- Probabilistic approaches  
- 1980's Back propagation invented  
- 90s-2020s: major advances in machine learning  
- Probability becomes integrated  
- Internet is invented  
	- Provides lots of data  
	- Provides lots of surface for collaboration  
- Deep learning explosion in 2008-2023  
	- Lots of data and computational power

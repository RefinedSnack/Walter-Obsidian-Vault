Identifies threats, threat agents, and attack vectors that the target system considers in scope to defend againstâ€”known from the past, or anticipated.  
O  
Approaches  
- [Diagram Threat Modeling](./Diagram%20Threat%20Modeling.md)  
- [DREAD](./DREAD.md)  
- [Attack Trees](./Attack%20Trees.md)  
- [STRIDE](./STRIDE.md)  
  
## Challenges (1.6.1)  
- Anticipating threats is difficult.  
- Trust challenges in Hotel Safebox.  
  
## Quality of Threat Model  
- Risks in model-reality gaps.  
- Major gaps from invalid assumptions.  
  
## What's Your Threat Model  
- Importance of adaptation.  
- Key question: What's your threat model?  
  
# Examples  
  
## Online Trading Fraud  
- Threat model failure.  
- Extracting money despite precautions.  
  
## Phishing Passwords  
- Vulnerability in one-time passwords.  
- Exploiting user trust.  
  
## Bypassing Defenses  
- Employees bypassing gateways.  
- External attacks facilitated by curiosity.  
  
## Debriefing  
- Incorrect assumptions lead to failures.  
- Iterative process in threat modeling.  
  
# Tying Security Policy  
  
## Outcome Scenarios  
1. Defenses fail to meet goals.  
2. Successful defenses make system secure.  
3. Incomplete policy allows unanticipated attacks.  
  
## Security Analysis  
- Identifying assets for refining requirements.  
- Testing challenges in assessing security.  
  
# Assurance Difficulties  
  
## Incomplete Assurance  
- Evaluation criteria change.  
- Continuous improvement for confidence.

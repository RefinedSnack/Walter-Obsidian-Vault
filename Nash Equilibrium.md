# Nash Equilibrium  
In [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory), the **Nash equilibrium**, named after the mathematician [John Nash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forbes_Nash_Jr. "John Forbes Nash Jr."), is the most common way to define the [solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_concept "Solution concept") of a [non-cooperative game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-cooperative_game "Non-cooperative game") involving two or more players. In a Nash equilibrium, each player is assumed to know the equilibrium strategies of the other players, and no one has anything to gain by changing only one's own strategy.

# Consequentialists  
  
  
For Consequentialists there is no (or less) distinction between *doing* and *allowing*  
  
For non-consequentialists it matters a great deal how a given harm has been brought about  
  
  
![Deontological Asymmetry](./Deontological%20Asymmetry.md)  
  
A constraint for non-consequentialists is that you are forbidden to cause harm for the greater good.  
  
(Kagen)  it \[the constraint\] is a barrier to the grater good

# Small-World Networks  
  
- "Most nodes can be reached by every other node by a small number of steps"  
  
### A distance based test  
  
if the average length grows slowly relative to the log(N) it is a small world  
  
Difficult to relate this to a single network  
  
Strait line test on log-x axis  
For a single network you have 2 options  
1. randomly remove nodes and track the way the network changes  
2. Compare to other samples with similar mechanism  
  
  
  
It must pass the strait line test AND the clustering coefficient must be sufficiently large to be considered a **small-world network**.

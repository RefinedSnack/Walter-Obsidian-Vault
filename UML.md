# UML  
  
Unified Modeling Language  
  
Helps to understand structure from both a Structural Perspective and a Behavioral Model.  
  
Can be used as a blueprint matches the [Big Design Up Front](Big%20Design%20Up%20Front.md) paradigm.  
  
UML has enough detail to be used as a programming language. (Bad practice)  
  
It is used mostly as a _sketch_ of a program  
  
cs340 will use it for [class diagrams](class%20diagrams.md) and [sequence diagrams](sequence%20diagrams.md)

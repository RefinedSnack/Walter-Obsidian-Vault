Example (Enumerating password authentication attacks). To construct a list of attacks on password authentication, one might draw a data flow diagram showing a password’s end-to-end paths, then identify points where an attacker might try to extract information. An alternative approach is to build an attack tree, with root goal to gain access to a user’s account on a given system. Which method is used is a side detail towards the desired output: a list of potential attacks to consider further (Figure 1.9)

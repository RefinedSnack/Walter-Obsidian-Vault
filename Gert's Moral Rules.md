# Gert's Moral Rules  
1. Do not kill  
2. Do not cause pain  
3. Do not disable  
4. Do not deprive of freedom  
5. Do not deprive of pleasure  
6. Do not deceive  
7. Keep your promises  
8. Do not cheat  
9. Obey the law  
10. Do your duty*  
  
* In this formulation, the term ‘duty’ is being used in its everyday sense to refer to what is required by one’s role in society, primarily one’s job, not as philosophers customarily use it, which is to say, simply as a synonym for ‘what one morally ought to do.’

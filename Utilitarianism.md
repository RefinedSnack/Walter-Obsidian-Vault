# Utilitarianism  
  
##### "Maximize the overall good"  
  
You might say that truth telling is usually a good approach, it engenders trust, allows for accurate communication and earns a good reputation. A utilitarian would then say that it is generally good. However, it is not always best to follow a rule.   
  
##### A utilitarian always examines the strict consequences before choosing to act  
  
  
#### Challenges  
- The precise means and values are not well defined. If one utilitarian has a view of good that another disagrees with they would choose different actions.  
- It does nothing to address to what extent an individual is free to choose their own perspective or view  
- prone to inaction, as no action itself is good and the future is uncertain  
- Means to an end arguments are bolstered here which has undesirable side effects  
- Really hard to answer the question "What is good?  
	- Proposed "Pleasure"  
		- Feels bad, generally accepted as not right  
	- John Stuart Mill argues that not just the quantity of happiness must be considered, not just the quality  
  
Major Objections  
- Personal Rights, or Justice objections  
	- Slavery is the common example  
	- Sacrifice the one for the many  
- Overdemanding  
	- Should we ALWAYS be focused on the greater good

- No time difficult, impossible  
  
##### Justice or Personal Rights

	- A doctor should not kill one health patient for their organs to save 5 others  
- Personal Rights are critical

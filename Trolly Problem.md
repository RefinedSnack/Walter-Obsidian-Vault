# Trolly Problem  
  
  
### Simple  
  
Almost everyone agrees  
Give a drug to save 5 vs 1  
Save 5 from drowning before trying to save the 1  
  
Number matter if all else is equal  
### Switch  
  
5 on one track  
1 on other  
  
Pull the switch and 1 dies  
Don't pull the switch and 5 die  
  
Majority will pull, [Deontological Ethics](./Deontological%20Ethics.md) has a problem became of the [Deontological Asymmetry](./Deontological%20Asymmetry.md)  
  
  
### The Fat Man  
  
No switch, but should you push the Fat Man onto the tracks to stop the train  
  
Majority says no  
  
### The Old Man  
  
Shoot an Old man off the pier to save 5 children from a shark  
  
Majority says no  
  
### Chunk's Organs

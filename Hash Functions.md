# Hash Functions  
  
- Properties of a cryptographic:  
    - [Preimage Resistance](./Preimage%20Resistance.md)  
    - [Second Preimage Resistance](./Second%20Preimage%20Resistance.md)  
    - [Collision Resistance](./Collision%20Resistance.md)  
  
- You want to store hashed passwords in a database. What properties do you need?  
	- All are ideal, [Preimage Resistance](./Preimage%20Resistance.md) is critical  
      
- You want to compute a digital signature of a hash. What attack can be stopped by a hash function that has second preimage resistance? What attack can be stopped by a hash function that has collision resistance?

# Artificial Intelligence  
  
A subset of [Intelligence](./Intelligence.md). Intelligence itself does not have a single agreed upon definitions.  
  
4 broad categories  
  
|  |  |  
| ---- | ---- |  
| Thinking Humanly | Thinking Rationally |  
| Acting Humanly | Acting Rationally |  
  
  
- Thinking Humanly  
- Acting Humanly  
- Thinking Rationally  
- Acting Rationally  
  
### Acting like Humans  
Consider Tasks Humans do:  
- Proving an theorem  
- Playing chess (and other games)  
- Planning a surgical operation  
- Diagnosing a disease  
- Navigating a building  
- Identifying objects from a photograph  
- Driving a car  
And build a system that does it automatically.  
  
[The Turing Test](./The%20Turing%20Test.md)  
  
### Thinking like Humans  
  
- How computer performs the task matters  
- The reasoning steps are important  
- Requires ability to create and manipulate symbolic knowledge  
	- Definitions  
	- Concepts  
	- Theorems  
- Requires scientific theories of the brain  
	- How abstract to do you go?  
	- How do you validate it is correct  
- Cognitive science and Neuroscience are distinct from AT  
- Does [Intelligence](./Intelligence.md) require a human-like thought process?  
- Can we create useful things before we reach sufficient understanding of humans?  
  
### Thinking Rationally  
  
- What are correct/incorrect arguments?  
- Aristotle and others started this a long time ago  
- Mathematics  
- Problems:  
	- Not all intelligent behavior is based on rational thinking  
	- Not all problems are solvable with this approach (The halting problem)  
  
### Acting Rationally  
- Rational behavior = doing the right/best thing  
- Right thing = thing expected to maximize goal achievement  
	- Connected to:  
		- Economics  
		- Control Theory  
		- Decision Theory  
- The argument here is Artificial Intelligence is not the same as Human Intelligence  
	- An implication is that we should not seek to define it as such  
	- We should not expect a computer and AI to be the same as a human in the same way as we should not expect a plane to fly like a bird.  
- Can machines act/thing intelligently  
	- AI has more and more impressive achievements  
	- Each success moves the bar  
		- Chess did this

# Computer Security  
  
The combined art, science and engineering practice of protecting computer-related assets from unauthorized actions and their consequences;  
either by   
- preventing such actions   
- detecting and then recovering from them.   
  
  
Computer security aims to protect data, computer hardware and software plus related communications networks, and physical-world devices and elements they control, from intentional misuse by unauthorized partiesâ€”i.e., access or control by entities other than the legitimate owners or their authorized agents.   
  
  
Mechanisms protecting computers against unintentional damage or mistakes, or that fall under the categories of reliability and redundancy, are also at times essential for overall computer security, but are not our main focus herein.

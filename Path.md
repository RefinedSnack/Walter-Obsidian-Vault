# Path  
  
A path from vertex u and vertex v is a sequence of **edges** that begins at vertex u and ends at a vertex v  
  
### Path length   
The number of edges used by the path  
  
Things with low path length are IMPORTANT  
  
We most often care about the Minimum path, this is defined as Distance on a graph

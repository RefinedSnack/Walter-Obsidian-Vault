# Jewish Tribal Heritage  
LDS falsely teach that "Jews are from the tribe of Judah"  
  
The Jews view themselves as being descendants of all the tribes, this also implies that the inherit all blessings and responsibilities associated with EVERY tribe.  
  
LDS believe and claim heritage from the [Lost Tribes of Israel](Lost%20Tribes%20of%20Israel.md)

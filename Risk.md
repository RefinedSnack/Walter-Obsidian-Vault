# Risk  
  
risk as the expected loss due to harmful future events, relative to an implied set of assets and over a fixed time period.  
  
depends on:   
- threat agents  
- the probability of an attack (and of its success, which requires vulnerabilities)  
- expected losses in that case  
  
Most common Risk equation:  
$$  
R = T \cdot V \cdot C  
$$  
- **T** reflects threat information (essentially, the probability that particular threats are instantiated by attackers in a given period).   
- **V** reflects the existence of vulnerabilities.  
- **C** reflects asset value, and the cost or impact of a successful attack.

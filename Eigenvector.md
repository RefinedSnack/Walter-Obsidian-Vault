# Eigenvector  
An [Invariant](Invariant.md) of the vector  
Most vectors rotate AND scale  
Eigen Vectors ONLY scale  
  
  
Question, on invariants, do we tend to observe a phenomena the find the invariant, or the other way round  
  
  
Is there a method for deriving this from the perspective of node degree

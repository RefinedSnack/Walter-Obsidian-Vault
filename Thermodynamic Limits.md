# Thermodynamic Limits  
  
- Thermodynamic limits  
    - physics: To set or clear a bit requires no less than 𝑘𝑇 “erg”  
        - 𝑘 is the Boltzman constant — 1.38×10−16 erg⁄°𝐾  
        - 𝑇 is the absolute temperature of the system  
    - assuming 𝑇=3.2°𝐾 (ambient temperature of universe)  
        - 𝑘𝑇=4.4×10−16 ergs  
    - annual energy output of the sun is 1.21×1041 ergs  
        - enough to cycle through a 187-bit counter in a year  
        - enough to cycle through a 192-bit counter after 32 years  
    - a supernova produces about 1051 ergs  
        - enough to cycle through a 219-bit counter

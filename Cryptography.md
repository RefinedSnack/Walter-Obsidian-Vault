The field responsible for the converting of plaintext documents into ciphertext documents.   
Highly relevant for communication methods that are susceptible to interception. Things like radio and the internet

Figure 2.1: Generic [Encryption](./Encryption.md) (E) and [Decryption](./Decryption.md) (D). For symmetric encryption, E and D use the same shared (symmetric) key k = k 0 , and are thus inverses under that parameter; one is sometimes called the “forward” algorithm, the other the “inverse”. The original Internet threat model (Chapter 1) and conventional cryptographic model assume that an adversary has no access to endpoints. This is false if malware infects user machines

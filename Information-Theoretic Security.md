# Information-Theoretic Security  
  
Information-theoretic security is a cryptographic paradigm based on principles from information theory. Key aspects of information-theoretic security include:  
  
## Basis of Security  
- **Foundation:** Grounded in mathematical concepts from information theory.  
- **Analysis:** Security is evaluated based on the fundamental limits imposed by information theory.  
  
## Security Assurance  
- **Unconditional Security:** Provides unconditional security guarantees, independent of the adversary's computational power.  
- **Invariance:** Security holds even in the face of adversaries with unlimited computational resources.  
  
## Adversary Model  
- **Assumption:** Assumes an adversary with unlimited computational resources.  
- **Unlimited Power:** Security guarantees remain intact irrespective of the adversary's time and computational capabilities.  
  
## Practical Implementations  
- **Challenges:** Implementation in practical systems can be challenging due to reliance on theoretical concepts.  
- **Efficiency:** Real-world counterparts of information-theoretic security may not always be efficient.  
  
Information-theoretic security offers a theoretical foundation for cryptography, focusing on fundamental limits rather than computational assumptions.

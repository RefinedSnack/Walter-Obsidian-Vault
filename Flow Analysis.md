# Flow Analysis  
Flow analysis is a traditional optimizing compiler technique for determining useful information about a program at compile time.  
  
A flow analysis problem is a question of the form:   
  
```c++  
“What is true at a given point p in my program, independent of the execution path taken to p from the start of the program?”  
```

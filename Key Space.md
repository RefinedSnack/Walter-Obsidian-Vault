# Key Space  
Key space is the domain of possible keys.  
The Caesar cypher where you shift all keys n digits over.   
The key space is 25. A large key space tends to be better  
The strength of your [Encryption](./Encryption.md) Algorithm relies on the size of the key space  
AES typically uses a key space of 256 bits = 2256Â possible keys

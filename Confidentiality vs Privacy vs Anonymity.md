# Confidentiality vs Privacy vs Anonymity  
  
  
Confidentiality involves information protection to prevent unauthorized disclosure  
  
A related term, privacy (or information privacy), more narrowly involves personally sensitive information, protecting it, and controlling how it is shared.  
  
privacy is related to anonymity—the property that one’s actions or involvement are not linkable to a public identity. While neither privacy nor anonymity is a main focus of this book, many of the security mechanisms we discuss are essential to support both.  
  
Each of these is important and should be treated with care
